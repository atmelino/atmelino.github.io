        The example turns a piece of text into sequences of maxlen (in this case 40) characters, and the correct value
        for each sequence (y in the training) is the subsequent characted for each sequence.<br>
        <br>

        In the inference/prediction phase, a sequence of characters is fed into the trained model, and the output is an
        array of probabilities for each of the characters that were present in the original text.<br>
        <br>



        ..<br>
        The function sample() is called to return the next predicted character.<br>
        <br>
        ..<br>

        <div class="code">
          preds = exp_preds / np.sum(exp_preds)
        </div>
        each value in a dataset is divided by the total sum of all values in that dataset. This results in a normalized
        list where the sum of the new values equals 1.<br>

        <h5>temperature parameter</h5>
        What does the temperature parameter in the language prediction do?<br>
        It varies the chances of characters with lower probabilities to be selected.<br>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the temperature is less than 1:<br>
            characters with lower probability than the one with the highest will be made even less likely to be
            selected.<br>
          </li>
          <li>
            If the temperature is 1:<br>
            no change.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the temperature is greater than 1:
            characters with lower probability than the one with the highest will be made more likely to be
          </li>
        </ul>

        The sample() function receives the predictions of each character as a probability.<br>
        <img src="images/LSTM_temperature_00.png" alt="LSTM_temperature_00" width="800"><br>
        The character of index 1 has a probability of 73% and the character of index 12 has a probability of 15%.<br>
        The ratio p(1)/p(12) is 4.8.<br>
        <br>
        temperature=0.5:<br>
        <img src="images/LSTM_temperature_01.png" alt="LSTM_temperature_01" width="800"><br>
        The character of index 1 has a probability of 95% and the character of index 12 has a probability of 4%.<br>
        The ratio p(1)/p(12) is 23.4<br>
        That means that the likelihood of character 1 being selected has been increased.<br>
